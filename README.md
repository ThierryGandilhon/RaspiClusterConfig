# RaspiClusterConfig
Automatic configuration of a Raspberry cluster using Ansible.
Used to manage my personal cluster of SBC with Ansible.

Cluster made of 4 machines :

* 001 : runs domoticz, and grafana
* 002 : runs rabbitmq (using MQTT proticol)
* 003 : runs node red
* 004 : runs influxdb (should also run grafana as well)
